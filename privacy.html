                        browser and stored on your device. Through them, certain information flows to the place that
                        sets the cookie, such as settings or data for exchange with the system. This helps us make
                        our website more user-friendly and overall effective. The legal bases for this are your consent
                        and our legitimate interests. Cookies cannot execute programs or transmit viruses to your
                        device.</p>
                    <p>We use persistent, and third-party cookies.</p>
                    <p>Persistent cookies remain on your device for the time being, so that we can recognize your
                        browser and for example, assign your preferred information and settings on your next visit.
                        Long-term cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period, which may vary depending
                        on the cookie.</p>
                    <p>When you visit our website, our partner companies also store third-party cookies on your device.
                        The cookies contain information about the way our website is used, e.g. which pages and products
                        were visited. The data is collected in a pseudonymized form by assigning an identification
                        number, which is not combined with any other personal data you may have provided to us.</p>
                    <p>You can delete cookies in your browser settings at any time or prevent them from being stored,
                        although the latter may result in a restriction of the functionality of our website for you. In

                        chosen delivery destination.</p>
