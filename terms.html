                    <p>Every order placed on the Site is uniquely manufactured by our printing partner. This process can
                        take up to 7 days.</p>

                    <p>Normally, goods are shipped within 5-10 days after the manufacturing takes place, but in certain
                        circumstances shipment and delivery can take up to three weeks.</p>

                    <p>Instart will make delivery using a shipment service provider of its choosing. The customer must
                        pay standard shipping costs which may depend on order value and shipping destination. Shipping
                        costs are displayed at checkout.</p>

                    <p>Our printing partner uses state of the art, direct to garment printing technology which results
                        in
                        a great variety of designs that can be printed on various products.</p>

                    <p>Due to differences in customers' computer monitor setup (how the colors are calibrated) the print
                        may differ slightly from what is presented on the Site. Some colors may come out slightly darker
                        or brighter or small details might blend together. Coloring can change between devices and
                        display settings.</p>

                    <p>By placing an order, you agree that you acknowledge this and products
                        attempted to be returned for such reasons may not be eligible for a return. We guarantee a
                        high-quality product, however nuances in colors are not up to our control, as every individual
                        may
                        have a different device they view their prospective order on.</p>

                    <p>The ink used is water based and eco-friendly. This makes the feel much softer than traditional
                        screen printed shirts, but just as durable. They use CPSIA (Consumer Product Safety Improvement
                        Act) compliant inks, which are required when printing on children's wear for ages 12 and below.

                    <p>If your product gets damaged in the mail or during manufacturing we will see that you get a
                        replacement product or possibly, a refund. Refunds are made on a case-by-case basis, but
                        generally, products that have been kept for longer than 21 days may not be returned. Similarly,
                        we are not responsible for orders that do not arrive on time for a specific occasion / holiday,
                        products that are accidentally ordered / now unwanted, or spelling errors made by the end user.
                        Of course, we want all our customers to be satisfied, and if you have a specific question / case
                        that does not fall within this policy, please send us an e-mail at: support@instart.design</p>

                    <p>We don't take responsibility in cases when the customer provides us with a correct delivery
                        address during the
                        ordering process. In such cases we won’t be able to guarantee a return if the error was made by
                        the purchaser.</p>

                    <p>Our printing partnera are not obligated to accept all designs we submit to them. If they
                        refuse to print the material we provide them, then we try to resolve the issue, but this
                        could lead to increase in shipping time.
                        In case we fail to find a resolution we issue a refound to the customer.</p>

                    <p>In the case where our printing partners are not able to deliver the ordered merchandise or not
                        able to fulfill due to their contractual obligations, we will inform the
                        customer immediately that the product ordered is not available.
                        Once the goods are shipped the risk of the goods being damaged or perished passes on to the
                        customer, this means that we are not liable for any damages caused by the shipping company.</p>

                    <p>Since the merchandise is created, designed and customized by the user, there is no right for
                        refund if the design is not due to the standards of the customer. In such a case this order is
                        not eligible for a return.</p>

                    <p>If the shipment information provided by the customer was incorrect at the time of order, it
                        results in a case where an order is not eligible for a return.</p>

                    <p>Once you  have confirmed the order via pressing the “Pay" or alike button, shipping
                        information such as address or name cannot be changed.</p>

                    <p>We are not responsible for notification in such a case and change the order however we will
                        always do our best to help resolve the issue. This means that there are no rights for the user
                        to receive replacement of products in dispute due to an address mistake. All of this is subject
                        to investigation, and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                    <p>Instart design reviews refund requests within 28 days of placed order. If there are product
                        quality issues we will replace such a product with a new product.</p>

                    <p>Customer must provide photo or video evidence of the faulty product in order to get their case
                        resolved.</p>

                    <p>Since every product is individually made, once the order is placed there is no right for
